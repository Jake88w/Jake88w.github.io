	<p> <font size="4"> when i'm not hitting the books im hitting the strings. 
	I may have a passion for music, particularly for guitars.

	<p> I dont ever believe one day ill be a rock star, i just like playing guitar.
		Strumming the string just to vibe makes me feel happy. Although, playing guitar has left its mark 
		on my left hand. I dont think i will ever be able to use any of the finger prints on my left hand. 
		I wonder if that will evver become a big deal... hmmm... Its worth it still. </p>

	<p> <font size="5"> Hobby #2  Illustration and Animation! </font> </p>
	
	<center> <img src="1506811_IMG/draw1.png" height="500" width="600" alt="error, image not found"/> </center>
	
	<p> Being an animation studio it should be no surprise that one of my
		hobbies is drawing or as it would be called, illustration</p>
		
	<p> I have done both illustration and animation but i tend to lean more
	towards illustration than animation. I even got to handle some paid illustration
	work over the year and i can safely say I have an all time favorite program which is Clip studio </P>

	<p> It's a digital illustration and animation software that leans more towards easter style animation 
		which is what i am all about drawing! </P>
	
	<p> Even tho I was taught and am capable of drawing different styles of media such as hyper realistic 
		and even 3D modelling, this style is my passion. Even tho my teachers had to fight me over 
		it ehe, sorry to the them for that </p>

	<p> even tho this is technically more of a career or job i think of it as a hobby as ive been doing it
		before even the thought of it as a job. from drawing scribbles on paper at 14 to now where ive even 
		invested alot of time and finances into it as my hobby!</p>
