		<p> Although quite a few challenges were face it was at this institution that i secured my CXC subjects
			over the period of 5 years. As you would think, a great many ordeals of foolishness and madness were
			to be had here.... those are be better left unsaid, being a bystander to them was pretty interesting tho. It should also be 
			noted that at this institution i excelled in my english	language courses with the help of a teacher
			that did her best to give me extra tutoring, thank you to her.
			
		<p> After all the struggle and strife i finally graduated from this institute </p>

		<p> The institute has done well so far in teaching its courses in my field but i still find it a 
			hard struggle when i come to do a module that is outside my field. a person who practices to
			draw,illustrate and model definitly struggled when doing college math 1b and sewing..... yeah.
			still currently am struggling with project management and computer research but ill do my best
			at it.</p>
