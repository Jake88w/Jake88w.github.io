		<p> #1 Self moderation is a good mindset tha has been an strong aspect of every piece of my life. its given me a mindset of "I will apply myself to this and do it". </p>
		<p> #2 Adaptability is another key strength I have, once im able to look into and understand a situation with enough time I can adjust to it as needed. </p>
		<p> #3 Motivation once i am able to get it, results in a goal that ive set or need getting done to the best of my ability. </p>
